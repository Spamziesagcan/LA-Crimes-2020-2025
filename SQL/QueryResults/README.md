# QueryResults Folder

This folder contains the **CSV output files** generated from SQL queries. These are used for:

- Charting and dashboard visualizations
- Reports and data exports
- Further analysis in Python or Excel

## Naming Convention

CSV files are typically named based on their query purpose. For example:

- `crime_by_district.csv`
- `monthly_trends.csv`

If applicable, each CSV file is linked to its corresponding query in the `SQL` folder.

> Note: Files are updated when source data or queries are updated.
